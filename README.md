## ⚠️ NOTE: The original repository we worked on has been privated. All collaborators are listed below.

Trust Circle is a group savings platform where friends or teammates contribute money on a recurring basis toward a shared goal. Members can request interest free loans from group funds, which the group can approve or deny. The app is designed to encourage financial consistency and collaboration through trust and transparency.

This app was developed for the SAP STAR Program Hackathon 2025
